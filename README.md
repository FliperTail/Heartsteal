# Heartsteal
Pretty much just Lifesteal but just differently named. For Minecraft servers at 1.12.2! You should pair it up with ViaVersion! Pretty basic that includes a revive syetem for dead players and withdrawing hearts!
This entire project is open source but editing credits and certain things aren't allowed as stated by the license. You may use this in ANY server no matter what. 
Heartsteal should work in the newer versions but was mainly made for 1.12.2 so keep that in mind if you use that for newer versions!

You won't get much support if you run it in anything other than 1.12.2!
