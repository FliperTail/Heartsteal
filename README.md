# Basic Information

A plugin made for spigot, bukkit, and paperspigot that is a lifesteal. It's named Heartsteal just stand out from the others. It provides a basic expierence in taking hearts away from a player when they die and give the heart to the killer. As well having the feature of withdrawing hearts so you can trade, store, or sell hearts to others on you're server! **This plugin uses bStats for information on usage!**

You can try to run it on newer versions, although no support for anything other than 1.12.2 since it's going to 100% work on 1.12.2 and most likely nothing else. 

## Other features

You can craft hearts and revive hearts. This is used for obvious reasons like getting extra health or bring back your teammate from the dead. You can see how the craft them in the description here or in the Gallery! The heart has the texture of the nether star and the revive has the texture of the ender perals!
